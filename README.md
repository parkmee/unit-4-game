# Crystal Collector
Use you math skills and a little bit of luck to match the target number. The values of the four crystals are randomly selected integers, as is the target number to reach (between 1 - 120). Users will click on one or more crystals in turn; each click increases the total score by the value of the crystal (from 1 - 12). A win is tallied if the target number equals the total number. If the total number surpasses the target number, a loss is tallied.

## Getting Started

Click any crystal to start the game. Each crystal is assigned a random value from 1-12. Clicking the crystal adds its value to the total score. Match the target number to win. You will lose if the total score exceeds the target number.
